This landing page was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's based on [flexdinesh's](https://github.com/flexdinesh) very simple yet elegant dev landing page repo on GitHub. I am hoping to add more of my custom styling as I learn more with React and SASS/CSS.

So far I replaced the parallax star background with a NPM package called [react-particle-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js) based on VincentGarreau's [particles-js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) using a bubble effect for the background.

## Technologies Used

* React
* SASS/CSS
* HTML
* NPM - [react-particle-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js)
* FontAwesome
* Flexdinesh's utils\scroll.js for detecting mouse scrolling behavior
