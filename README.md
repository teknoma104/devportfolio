This landing page was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's based on [https://github.com/flexdinesh](flexdinesh's) very simple yet elegant dev landing page repo on GitHub. I am hoping to add more of my custom styling as I learn new things with React and SASS/CSS.

So far I replaced the parallax star background with a NPM package called [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js](react-particle-js) based on VincentGarreau's [https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/](particles-js) using a bubble effect for the background.
